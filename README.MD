# Hypertension Risk Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the risk of hypertension using machine learning techniques. It is aimed at helping healthcare professionals and researchers assess whether an individual is at risk based on medical and demographic features.

## 📊 Project Overview

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a major public health concern. Early prediction can help prevent complications such as heart attacks, stroke, and kidney failure. This notebook demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict hypertension risk using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and various classification models.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
